# MEASUREMENT

!!! info "Measurement"
    High quality measurement/sampling is the basis of data analysis, and TinySHM fully considers this in its design. We have implemented a variety of measurement/sampling methods in TinySHM, and users can choose according to their needs.

!!! warning
    Currently, development is based on ESP32, and migration to platforms like STM32 will require some modifications to the adaptation layer.
