# MATH OPERATIONS

!!! note
    This component is designed for **mathematical operations**. It is a lightweight library that provides basic mathematical functions to facilitate onboard computation and AI model inference. The library is designed to be **lightweight and efficient**, making it suitable for edge computing applications.

!!! note
    This component is a wrapper and extension of the official ESP32 digital signal processing library [ESP-DSP](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dsp/en/latest/esp32/index.html), providing higher-level API interfaces. In simple terms, the TinyMath library corresponds to the Math, Matrix, and DotProduct modules in ESP-DSP, while the other modules in ESP-DSP correspond to the TinyDSP library.
